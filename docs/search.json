The app creates a conclusion intended for an abstract of a scientific paper based on the value and interpretation of the estimate and confidence interval. The app has two modes: Stat is the default mode and the mode MD, which is not recommended, is only included for completeness."

The Quiz mode can then be selected and here the user can try to guess the location of own data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQQ generator"
