## Conclusion generator

[https://erik-parner.shinyapps.io/conclusion/](https://erik-parner.shinyapps.io/conclusion/)

This app is inspired by the Peter Bacchetti's lecture on "Common Biostatistical Problems and the Best Practices that Prevent Them" and a conclusion generator that used to be on 
[ctspedia.org](ctspedia.org). The app creates a conclusion for an abstract of a scientific paper based on the estimates and confidence intervals, and interpretation of estimate and confidence limits.
