## Conclusion generator

[https://apps.biostat.au.dk/erikparner/Conclusion/](https://apps.biostat.au.dk/erikparner/Conclusion/)

This app is inspired by the Peter Bacchetti's lecture on "Common Biostatistical Problems and the Best Practices that Prevent Them" and a conclusion generator that used to be on [ctspedia.org](ctspedia.org). The app creates a conclusion intended for an abstract of a scientific paper based on the value and interpretation of the estimate and confidence interval. The app has two modes: *Stat* is the default mode and the mode *MD*, which is not recommended, is only included for completeness. When both estimate and confidence limits have the same interpretation, a more simplified conclusion can be obtained, but this scenario is at present outside the scope of the app.
