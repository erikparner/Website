This app is inspired by the Peter Bacchetti's lecture on "Common Biostatistical Problems and the Best Practices that Prevent Them" and a conclusion generator that used to be on [ctspedia.org](ctspedia.org). The app creates a conclusion intended for an abstract of a scientific paper based on the value and interpretation of the estimate and confidence interval. The app has two modes: *Stat* is the default mode and the mode *MD*, which is not recommended, is only included for completeness. 


## QQ generator

This app simulates QQ-plots with a given number of observation. The user can set the principle of generating the QQ-plot: line-type="Full range" uses all observations to determine the line; line-type="25-75 percentile" uses the data between the 25 and 75 percentile to determine the line; and line-type="2.5-97.5 percentile" uses the data between the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile to determine the line. The QQ-plot can be compared to data from a Excel file (first column is assumed to contain the data with no variable name).
